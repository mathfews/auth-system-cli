# Auth System CLI – Python Authentication System
Auth System CLI is a terminal-based authentication system developed in Python.
It handles user registration and login with secure password hashing and persistent storage.

This project was built to practice authentication logic, password security, and structured backend design.

## 🚀 What This Project Demonstrates
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Secure password hashing using SHA-256
- User authentication logic
- Input validation and error handling
- Persistent data storage with JSON
- Separation of concerns and modular code structure

---

## ✨ Features
- User registration
- Secure login system
